If you were just like me and any other ~crazy~ passionate developer out there, there must be one or more occasions where you were looking for a way to build your very own browser. And of course, after [some](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-make-a-web-browser-like-Brave-or-Firefox-from-scratch) [quick](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/598841/how-to-get-started-building-a-web-browser) [searches](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37608860), you buried the idea for good and go on with your life.

But, as the old proverb says: *"Half a loaf is better than none"*. If you can't build it from scratch, use what's provided.

## The Dominance
Whatever browsers that you use reading this article at this moment, [98%+ chance](https://www.similarweb.com/browsers/) that it will fall into one of these three browser engines:
- [Blink](https://www.chromium.org/blink/) which powers the chromium-based browsers ([Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Brave](https://brave.com/), [Microsoft Edge](https://microsoft.com/edge/), etc), or
- [WebKit](https://webkit.org/) which powers [Apple's Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/) browser
- [Gecko](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Gecko) which powers firefox-based browsers ([Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/), [Floorp](https://floorp.app), etc).

Taking those data into account, I should try to use the most popular browsers (chromium-based browser) for this project, right? Well, yes. But in this project, I will try to build a Firefox browser instead.

Why? **Artifact's precompilation**.

## The Thing
My target is only to make a tiny modification (compared to [40+ million lines of code](https://openhub.net/p/firefox/analyses/latest/languages_summary) inside it) in the branding and front end side of the browser. I don't need to touch the compiled side (or the backend side) of the browser.

In Firefox, we can use [Artifact Mode](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/contributing/build/artifact_builds.html#understanding-artifact-builds) to easily download and use pre-built C++ components rather than building them locally. That way, my little system which in no way is not optimisedly configured for browser development can have an easier time in this experiment.

I might be wrong on this, but I can't find something similar in the Chromium-based browsers. If there's a similar thing, I'd be blaming the official docs for not explaining that ðŸ¤·.
